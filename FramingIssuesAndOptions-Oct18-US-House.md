# Open Questions:

## Guideposts for Initial Blockchain Legislative Action?

###  Balancing Technology Specification Neutrality
How to avoid unintended consequences of technical specification (too much detail and/or not accurately targeted detail):
* Locking in "today's how" we accomplish the process instead of describing "timeless what" a process must accomplish
* Risk freezing innovation by legislatively enshrining market winners and/or rapid obsolescence of the law because the market evolves beyond the legislatively specified technology

"But only if..." + Technology Specific

###  Providing appropriate defaults & gap fillers
* Following, supporting and reflecting best practices
* Filling gaps with novel rules to correct demonstrated market failures

### Extending Demonstrably Successful State and Other Laws  
* UETA to ESIGN was good example

### Removing legal obstacles to beneficial commercial or social practices
* eliminating prior media specific legal lock-in
* clarifying uncertainty applicable law
* reassuring risk-averse counsel of legality


## Scope and Application of Definitions

###  Matching Legal Significance of Key Functions & Capabilities

Within the scope of the body of law under consideration:

* EG: Security Procedure and Record Integrity
* EG: Store/Print Safeguard and Later Discoverability
* EG: Attribution/Liability and Linkable Identifiers
* EG: Notice/Posting and Public Verifiability

###  Implications of foreseeable subsequent legislation

Definitions and rules reuse, revision or reversal in future Blockchain legislation in other areas of law and regulation

* Individual Identity and Personal Data
* Legal Notices and Authoritative Records
* Public Algorithms and Due Processors
